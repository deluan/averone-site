		<p>The Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics - IBOPE - supplies the largest collection of information about the Brazilian and Latin American   markets. The IBOPE Group is a Brazilian multinational composed of 52 companies,   employing over 2.800 professionals and acting&nbsp;in&nbsp;16 countries.</p><br/>
		<p>Company has a service to verify if a particular ad was viewed on tv at the correct time and date. At first, this check was a manual process made by   contractors, using images pre-recorded in VCR&rsquo;s. Cost problems, as well as   demanding time, defines electronic checking mandatory.</p><br/>
		<p>The solution: Video recognition by comparison through a database of 20,000 ads. A machine running VFP, takes 4 minutes to compare pre-recorded video blocks   (30&rsquo; blocks) with the full database of ads. The engine was integrated to another   proprietary tool that creates reports and alerts.</p><br/>
		<p>Ibope uses the engine since 2005 with full success.</p><br/>
